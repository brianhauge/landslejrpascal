= How to initialize the Pascal package on a object =

== Seperate "Actions" layer ==
In my example, I've created a seperate "Actions" layer to contain all the initializing of the *Pascal* package on the element.

== Import and initialize Pascal on a object ==

In the "Actions - frame" part of the *Actions* layer I start by importing the Pascal package

{{{
import com.fdf.pascal.Pascal;
}}}

The *Pascal* constructor takes to required arguments:
  # _this.stage_ is the current movie stage
  # _laboratoryObject_ is the object which the class is going to be working on

{{{
public function Pascal(theStage, laboratoryObject : MovieClip) {
}}}

*Important!*
The _laboratoryObject_ argument have to be set on the object inside Flash

=== Example ===

In order to initialize the Pascal package on the object named _dkmap_ the code looks like this

{{{
import com.fdf.pascal.Pascal;

new Pascal(this.stage, dkmap);
}}}

At this very time, I have implemented the Glow/Hover effect in the class so the outcome looks like this, when hover the dkmap object
